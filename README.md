Various dotfiles, config files and scripts for everyday use.

## screenrc
Uses screen with a split to display two sessions at the same time: the main (larger) window up top runs vim (which has a bunch of extensions including a NERDTree file-browser in its own window on the left); and a smaller bottom window running a shell for using command-line tools.
